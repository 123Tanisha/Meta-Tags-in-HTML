# Meta-Tags-in-HTML
All the meta tags 

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>charset attribute</strong> specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.<br>
  That means that this tag gives information to the browser about what characters are used on the webpage.<br>
  The one that you will use on your web pages is the UTF-8 character set, which covers any character or symbol you can type!</li><br><br>
  
  <li>A <strong>meta description</strong> is an HTML element that provides a brief summary of a web page. A pageâ€™s meta description tag is displayed as part of the search snippet in a search engine results page.<br>
  To create a description meta tag, the value of its name attribute needs to be description<br>
  We also need a content attribute. This is where you put the actual description of the website.</li><br><br>

  <li><strong>Meta keywords</strong> allow you to do is list a few keywords that your website is related to. This will help search engines know which searches are related to your website, so they know when to show your website as a result.<br>
The name attribute should be set to keywords. Inside the content attribute, you can put the keywords separated by a comma.</li><br><br>

<li>The browser's <strong>viewport</strong> is the area of the window in which web content can be seen. The web content can be a different size than the window, so the browser gives us scroll bars to be able to scroll down and see the whole page.<br>
On mobile phones and some other devices, the browser renders all the content in really big dimensions and then shrinks it to fit the screen of the phone. Users can then zoom in to see parts of the page. This mechanism has a couple of problems, and the viewport meta tag can fix them.<br>
The viewport meta tag should have the name of viewport, and to make sure it is working properly its content should be: width=device-width, initial-scale=1</li>
</ul>
